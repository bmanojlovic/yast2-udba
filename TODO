How this is suppose to work... (for now)

- user selects UDBA from yast or starts udba script (same...)
- user is provided with list of already installed recipes something like
  picture bellow 

--------------------------------------------------------------
|     Package Name    | Built |    Descritption              |
|=====================+=======+==============================|
| udba-nvidia-gfxG3   |  Yes  |  Provides Nvidia Latest dr...|
| udba-ati-gfxG0      |  No   |  Provides Legacy driver for..|
| udba-broadcom-sta   |  Yes  |  Broadcom driver...          |
|                     |       |                              |

                 [Install new recipe] [Build package] [Remove]

- On Selection what to build scr is called with parameters
 - ag_udba_build_scr <package name> 
   package name automaticly select data from rpm info which tar.gz file to
   use and is used for creating repository information
- complex package is package which needs to build with 2 build cycles (or more?)
  probably video driver components e.g. nvidia-kmp and X11-nvidia-gfx

- on succesfull build, agent should call createrepo on produced rpm files
  thus creating repository descriptor file which should be added to zypper
  repositories list and explained to user (or auto install?) how to install
  given packages from repository in this way if vendor ever provides
  packages they should have bigger relevance than our locally built packages.

- if build is not succesfull ask user to send build log for analysis...
  DO NOT run create repo in that case


- Extend this package with apache configuration that would allow exporting
  of created repositories to other machines on lan - good for companies so
  not everyone should do these tasks by themselfs (>100mbs downloads...)
  folder should be /srv/udba-repos/ and all package folders mapped to:
      http://hostname/udba/ or like



TODO:
	what if there is no internet for user??
	maybe ask user to provide "source" packages into /usr/share/udba/xxx
        self todo: fix build-udba-recepies :)
